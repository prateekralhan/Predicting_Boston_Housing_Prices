# Predicting_Boston_Housing_Prices

#Install

This project requires Python 3 and the following Python libraries installed:

    NumPy
    Pandas
    matplotlib
    scikit-learn

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a Jupyter Notebook. You can either do this using pip or use anaconda for running jupyter notebooks.

The project mainly deals with analysing and testing different datasets and algorithms like Gradient Descent, Linear Regression, 
Logistic Regression etc. and use these "tools" and find a model that gives us the best generalization. From this, we estimate the price of a particular house for our client and justify it.
